I write [articles on design and code](/articles/) and curate [a weekly newsletter](/newsletter/) for designers and front-end web developers. I also keep
[notes on things I’m learning](/notes/) from books, courses and interesting things I find from various places on the internet.

Currently I live in Sri Lanka, where I work with a handful of clients. In my free time I enjoy running, climbing, hiking and skiing. I practice yoga and meditation most mornings.

## Where to go next

Alternatively, take a look at [my CV](pdf/murshid-azher-cv-may-20.pdf) to get an idea of my experience.

If you’re more interested in [how I buit this site](/build/), I’ve tried my best to list all the tools and techniques I used. Check out my [uses](/uses/) page, if you want to know

occasionally I check my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/murshidazher), but I’m not very good at responding.
