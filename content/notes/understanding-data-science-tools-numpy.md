## What is NumPy

In the whole of machine learning process, NumPy is a tool which helps you to form the foundation for turning your data into a series of numbers, feed them into your machine learning algorithm and leave the rest to the machine to figure out the patterns among those numbers.

NumPy primarily falls under the **Data Analysis** section in the machine learning pipeline, but will also be using it in the Modeling section too (when finding the patterns among those numbers).

## Why NumPy

> 🤔&nbsp;&nbsp; Why NumPy and not using pure python to do numeric calculations?

- **Performance** - When doing large scale calculations NumPy outperforms python inbuilt math modules because NumPy  underneath the hood is written using `C`.
- **Speed** - To get optimizations in speed, NumPy uses a process called vectorization via `broadcasting`. Which essentially means that just avoiding loops when you're writing calculations.
- **Community** - NumPy is the backbone of other popular packages when using machine learning hence if you're using one of these packages then integrating NumPy with them would be easy. i.e `pandas`, `mathplotlib`
