These are my notes from [What can we learn from shortcuts](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_hulme_what_can_we_learn_from_shortcuts), a TED Talk by designer and Google Ventures Partner [Tom Hulme](https://twitter.com/thulme).

“Empathy for what your customers want is the biggest leading indicator of business success“

How do you build a product people really want? Allow consumers to be a part of the process.

Shortcuts are desire paths — often the path of least resistance.
The point where design and user experience diverge.

## Applying this to launching products

Design for a real need at low friction.

People are resourceful, they will always find the low friction routes, to save money and time.

Observing the user behaviour will help you design better products.

Co-design with the user.

Launch and learn. Launching early will teach you what people really want. It’s an efficient way of spotting desire paths.

The worlds in flux, respond to changes.

Watch for desire paths to emerge, then take the appropriate action.

## Summary

- Design for real life: for real human needs
- Empathy for what your customers want is the biggest leading indicator of business success
- Design in low friction
- launch and learn: The answer is out there, not inside the building. Observer users behaviour to find out what they really want
- stay responsive: respond to change
