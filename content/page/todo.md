### Testing 

[ ] Implement a Testing Framework
[ ] Look into JMeter
[ ] [Cheatsheet Master The Coding Interview ](https://github.com/chesterheng/master-coding-interview)


- Start learning a new language this week. Always programmed in the
same old language? Try Clojure, Elixir, Elm, F#, Go, Haskell,
Python, R, ReasonML, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, TypeScript, or
anything else that appeals and/or looks as if you might like it.

- Start reading a new book (but finish this one first!). If you are doing
very detailed implementation and coding, read a book on design
and architecture. If you are doing high-level design, read a book on
coding techniques.

- Get out and talk technology with people who aren’t involved in your
current project, or who don’t work for the same company. Network
in your company cafeteria, or maybe seek out fellow enthusiasts at
a local meetup.
