I’m in London, on lockdown due to the Covid-19 Coronavirus outbreak. I’m well, but I’m at home to help prevent the spread. This is how I’m spending my time right now.

### Current Projects

- I’m building a UI style guide generator with Eleventy, which takes a set of [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) stored as yaml data and turns them into Sass variables to use in your styles, and JSON to use in your templates. The idea is inspired by [Andy Bell’s Hylia Starter Kit](https://hylia.website/styleguide/).
- I just launched [Local London](https://locallondon.life), a directory of London food & drink suppliers who deliver to your door. I’m working on the project with my friend Rozzy in response to the Covid-19 outbreak.
