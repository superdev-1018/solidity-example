## Who I am

My name is Harry Cresswell, I’m an independent designer and front-end web developer from London, England.

I’ve spent the last 7 years helping startup businesses and independent individuals get set up online.

## What I do

To put it simply I design and code content based websites.

From concept through to launch, I wireframe, prototype and code designs into fully functioning websites.

My tools of choice are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I specialise in creating “Jamstack” websites with Hugo and Eleventy, and eCommerce stores using Shopify.

I also implement content management systems using Forestry, Netlify CMS and Sanity, so you can manage the content on your website.

If you are looking for an app developer, or someone to help create a website driven by user data, then I’m not your guy.

The websites I build are robust and cost effective to run. They load fast and are optimised for search engines. They aim to meet accessibility standards and be as inclusive as possible, so you can call those who use assistive technologies your customers.

## How I work

I believe that communication and collaboration are vital to the success of a project.

I like to keep the process as dynamic and fluid as possible. We’ll move thoughtfully and efficiently in the most appropriate direction until we find the right solution.

I’m not afraid to ask questions, sometimes they might sound stupid, but the better I understand your vision, the sooner I can help you create the right product.

I won’t disappear for weeks on end then deliver a product which doesn’t meet your expectations. Instead you’ll be involved through every step of product development, so we’re on the same page from start to finish.

## Who hires me

I work with startups, small businesses, agencies and individuals who need a web developer with a good understanding of design, who is experienced in launching products online.

My clients tend to be those keen to execute ideas, but don’t necessarily have the technical skills to do so. Or those who’d rather save on big agency fees by investing their budget in good design, at an affordable rate, from an independent designer.

## What I charge

My rate varies depending on your situation and needs.

I charge a flat fee for all projects, so no hourly rate, just a single project price.

If you are an independent individual just starting out, then I will charge a considerable amount less than if you are an established business who has just raised investment.

If you are a non-profit organisation or charity then I will often waiver my fee entirely.

## Get in touch
