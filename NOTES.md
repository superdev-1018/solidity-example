## To Run

```
hugo server -D
```

- [custom font](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/import-font-in-custom-css/9763)
- you can use in the title `slug: abooot` so that would make the link redirect to `abooot` when clicked. `slug` only change the end part of the file.
- for specific page renders look into [this](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).
- `.` passes the context
- we use hugo `pipes` - an asset pipeline; for cache busting - `fingerprint` and send css through asset pipelines.
